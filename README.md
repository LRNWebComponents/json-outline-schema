# JSON Outline Schema

JSON Outline Schema is a standard way of expressing and storing the relation between objects. It gives you a simple way of linking data together to form an outline of related concepts / entities. Here is an example of a JSON Outline schema entity:
```json
{
  "id": "unique-id-of-the-item-1",
  "indent": "1",
  "location": "name-of-some-file-or-location.html",
  "order": "0",
  "parent": "unique-id-of-the-parent",
  "title": "Name of some file or location",
  "metadata": {}
}
```
This gives you enough data to visually represent this information in an outline form. Let's look at a larger example of 3 items related together which would express nested hierarchy in a consistent way:
```json
{
  "id": "123-ddc-d321d-d2e-dd2",
  "title": "My outline",
  "author": "LRNWebComponents",
  "description": "A series of related material to teach you about the structure of content.",
  "license": "by-sa",
  "metadata": {},
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "item-1",
      "indent": "1",
      "location": "outline.html",
      "order": "0",
      "parent": null,
      "title": "Outline",
      "metadata": {
        "icon": "icons:view-quilt"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "item-2",
      "indent": "2",
      "location": "introduction.html",
      "order": "0",
      "parent": "item-1",
      "title": "Introduction to outlines",
      "metadata": {}
    },
    {
      "id": "item-3",
      "indent": "2",
      "location": "files/a-2nd-page-item.html",
      "order": "1",
      "parent": "item-1",
      "title": "An item in an outline",
      "metadata": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

Let's break down thes properties and why we have them in the schema:
## Higher order schema
- `title` - name of the work as a whole
- `author` - who created this work
- `description` - short description of the work to explain it
- `license` - a valid license short hard for the work as a whole
- `metadata` - area to storing any additional details about the work. This has no standard structure but could be used for relating work if needed.
- `id` - a unique identifier for this work in the universe of all works
- `items` - an array of schema elements which contain the pages / leaves of the structure of this outline

## Leaf / page element within the structure
- `id` - the UUID / unique ID of the element
- `indent` - How far to visually position the item inward. You could have something be the parent as a page but visually only be indented 2 levels
- `location` - a file or resource that references the related data to display here
- `order` - a weighting as to the order relative to other items that match this parent level
- `parent` - a UUID / unique ID of the element this is a child of
- `title` - title of this item to display
- `metadata` - a container for any additional details of information you need to ship. This has no standard structure
